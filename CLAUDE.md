**Read [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) first.** It is the model-neutral instruction file and the source of
truth for this repository. This file adds only Claude-specific guidance.

## The things most likely to trip you up here

1. **Zero runtime dependencies.**
2. **Every method throws** (ADR-0003); SDK errors extend `QeetIDError`.
3. **Wire fields stay `snake_case`** (ADR-0004); options are camelCase.
4. **Only routes an API key may call.** Check the OpenAPI document and the server's route policy.
5. **Retries never repeat a write** (ADR-0005): GET, DELETE, `retrySafe` POSTs and idempotency-keyed
   requests only; never `auth.session_revoked`.
6. **Never weaken** `src/webhooks/verify.ts`, `src/tokens/verifier.ts` or `src/core/http.ts`.

## Working style

- **Read before editing.** Match the neighbouring resource file rather than introducing an abstraction.
- Use the architecture map instead of guessing a path.
- **Do not read `.env*` or secret files** into anything you write.

## Finishing a change

```bash
bun run verify
git diff
```

## Escalate rather than proceed

Stop and report if a task would weaken a security control, change a published contract, or require
modifying another repository.
